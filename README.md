Disease Prediction Models
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and supporting files for predicting three different diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. Each prediction model has its own dataset, trained model, and scaler for preprocessing. Additionally, there is a Python script (app.py) for integrating these models.

Files and Directories:

Jupyter Notebooks
Diabetes Prediction.ipynb: Notebook containing the code and steps to build and evaluate a diabetes prediction model.
Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb: Notebook containing the code and steps to build and evaluate a heart disease prediction model.
Parkinson's Disease Detection.ipynb: Notebook containing the code and steps to build and evaluate a Parkinson's disease detection model.

Datasets
diabetes dataset.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the diabetes prediction model.
heart (1).csv: Dataset used for training and testing the heart disease prediction model.
parkinsons.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the Parkinson's disease detection model.

Saved Models
diabetes_model.sav: Trained model for diabetes prediction.
heart_disease_model.sav: Trained model for heart disease prediction.
parkinsons_disease_model.sav: Trained model for Parkinson's disease detection.

Scalers
scaler_diabetes.sav: Scaler used for preprocessing the diabetes dataset.
scaler_heart.sav: Scaler used for preprocessing the heart disease dataset.
scaler_parkinsons.sav: Scaler used for preprocessing the Parkinson's disease dataset.

Python Script
app.py: Python script for integrating the models and making predictions.

Requirements
